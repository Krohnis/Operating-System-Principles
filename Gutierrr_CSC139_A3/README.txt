COMPILE
gcc GRA3.c

RUN
a.out <input file> <schedueling algorithm> <time quantum>
	e.g. for each algorithm
		a.out input.1 FCFS
		a.out input.1 RR 2
		a.out input.1 SRTF
	Including additional parameters will do nothing, invalid schedueling algorithms will return a print statement error
		and end the run

All outputs match those from the appendix, and I have tested a few others and assume that they are right

input.1 is the input from the appendix, input.2 is one of the tests I created
